# Performance Comparison: Loops vs NumPy

## Test Configuration
- Array size: 1,000,000 elements
- Operation: Revenue calculation (price × quantity)

## Results

### Loop-Based Approach
- Execution time: 0.2693 seconds
- Method: Python for loop with list append

### NumPy Vectorized Approach
- Execution time: 0.0645 seconds
- Method: Element-wise array multiplication

## Performance Analysis

### Speedup
- **Speedup factor:** 4.17x faster
- **Performance improvement:** 76.0%

### Why NumPy is Faster

1. **Compiled Code**: NumPy operations are implemented in C, which is much faster than interpreted Python code.

2. **Vectorization**: NumPy processes multiple elements simultaneously using CPU vectorization (SIMD instructions).

3. **No Loop Overhead**: Python loops have significant overhead for each iteration. NumPy eliminates this overhead.

4. **Memory Efficiency**: NumPy uses contiguous memory blocks, which improves cache performance.

5. **Optimized Algorithms**: NumPy uses highly optimized BLAS/LAPACK libraries for numerical operations.

## Conclusion

For large-scale data processing, NumPy vectorization provides significant performance benefits over Python loops. The speedup of 4.17x demonstrates why vectorization is essential in data engineering workflows.

## Recommendations

- Always prefer NumPy vectorized operations over Python loops for numerical computations
- Use vectorization even for small arrays to maintain code consistency
- Consider NumPy when processing datasets with 10,000+ elements
